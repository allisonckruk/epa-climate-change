# The EPA's Climate Change Site

President Trump [has ordered the EPA](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-climatechange-idUSKBN15906G) to remove their [climate change page](https://www.epa.gov/climatechange) from their website.

People are already working to download all the information there. This repository is intended to be a temporary solution to keep the material accessible on the web. They have a ton of information, so please open pull requests to add more pages to this collection.

[Here's the site on the Way Back Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170125022503/https://www.epa.gov/climatechange), in case it does go down super soon.

If anyone knows of a similar project, please link to it here.
